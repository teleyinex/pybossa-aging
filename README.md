This is an application created for the PyBossa framework. The goal of the app is to study how good we are guessing the age of persons.

The application gets 20 Flickr images taken during the 2nd Citizen Cyberscience Summit (in London) and show them to people.

You can try the application in http://demo.pybossa.com
